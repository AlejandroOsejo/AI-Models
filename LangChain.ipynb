The AI revolution's stakes are high, making cooperation across borders essential. No nation can tackle these complex challenges alone. With proactive policies and international support, developing countries can shape the trajectory of AI and maximize its benefits, but they must seize this transformative opportunity now. This paper examines the uneven global impact of AI, highlighting how its effects will be a function of (i) countries' sectoral exposure to AI, (ii) their preparedness to integrate these technologies into their economies, and (iii) their access to essential data and technologies. We feed these three aspects into a multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model of the global economy and show ...

For instance, AI could automate jobs, disproportionately affecting low-skilled workers, and exacerbate the digital divide. On the other hand, AI could also increase productivity, improve healthcare outcomes, and enhance access to education. To mitigate these risks, developing countries must invest in AI, develop proactive labor policies, and prioritize international cooperation and skills development. This could involve providing training programs for workers to acquire new skills, implementing policies to protect workers' rights, and fostering partnerships with international organizations to share best practices and expertise.
